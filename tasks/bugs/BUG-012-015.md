# BUG-012 through BUG-015: Documentation inaccuracies

**Severity:** LOW/MEDIUM
**Found:** 2026-02-05
**Found By:** Audit Layer 5 (Documentation)
**Status:** FIXED (partial)

## Issues

### BUG-012: SYSTEM-STATE.md Phase 3 description (FIXED)
- **Old:** Said Phase 3 "NOT INCLUDED"
- **New:** Changed to "WIRED BUT INACTIVE"
- **Reality:** Components ARE wired into main.py but not yet producing active data

### BUG-013: INDEX.md bug count (FIXED)
- **Old:** Claimed "Open Bugs: 0"
- **New:** Shows accurate bug status table with all tracked bugs

### BUG-014: "Binance" references (NO ACTION NEEDED)
After review, all "Binance" references are contextually appropriate:
- ADDING-FEATURES.md: Example showing how to add a different exchange
- AUDIT-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-FRAMEWORK.md: Audit instructions
- DEVELOPMENT-DISCIPLINE.md: Drift check commands

These are not bugs - they're either examples or meta-documentation about what to check for.

### BUG-015: "45 coins" references (NO ACTION NEEDED)
After review, all "45 coins" references are audit instructions explaining what to check for,
not actual claims about our coin count. No changes needed.

## Fixed In
TBD - pending commit
